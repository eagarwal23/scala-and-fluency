#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

I spent a total of approximately 5.5 hours on this assignment:
- 2.5 hours on parts 1-4 of the assignment, installing and familiarizing myself with Scala
- 2 hours on parts 5-6 of the assignment in building my own functions, adding fluency to the picture library, and modifying the tests accordingly
- 1 hour on attempting to implement new functions, i.e. blur, bisectHorizontally, and bisectVertically. I did not have much trouble creating the bisecting functions, however, I spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand the algorithm for and attempting to comprehend which functions and methods to use to implement the Solarize and Blur functions.
# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.

- In using Scala, I found many similarities between it and Python as well as Java. A question I wanted to ask was that why is it then that we use Scala, and not Python or Java, in implementing DSLs? Does it have some features which make it better-suited for this purpose?
- I wasn't able to view the output image of my PictureProgram, I would really like to discuss a little more about the structure of a Scala program when using Image Processing
- I would like to please discuss the algorithms for the Solarize and Blur function as well as the parameters needed to be able to implement these.
